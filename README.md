spotify-export
==============

Let's convert a Spotify playlist into plain text!

1. Open Spotify and go to the playlist that you want to export
2. Select the tracks that you want to export (Ctrl-A to Select All)
3. Right-click on the selected tracks and choose "Copy HTTP Link" from the menu
4. Go to the text editor of your choice and Paste
5. Save the file
6. Run ./spotify-export.rb your-filename.txt

Running the command on the included test.txt file will produce the following output:

    1. Wildest Moments -- Jessie Ware -- Devotion
    2. The Twist -- Frightened Rabbit -- The Midnight Organ Fight
    3. Dark Star -- POLIÃ‡A -- Give You The Ghost
    4. Love Get Out Of My Way -- Monarchy -- Around The Sun
    5. Cookie -- The Presets -- Down Down Down
    6. Make You Mine -- Miami Horror -- Bravado
    7. Don't Deny Your Heart -- Hot Chip -- In Our Heads
    8. The Drummer -- Niki & The Dove -- Instinct
    9. Not In Love -- Crystal Castles and Robert Smith -- (II)
    10. Anyway You Choose To Give It -- The Black Ghosts -- The Black Ghosts

Listening to the songs might be fun too.

Enjoy!
